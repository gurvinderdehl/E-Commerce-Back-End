# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a back end database through the use of the following features, which enabled me to do so, these being, MySQL, Sequelize, NodeJS and all API routes tested through Insomnia Core. 

## Installation
* To install the necessary packages to run this application, run ``npm install`` in your CLI, then to use the database, you will need to change the credentials in the connection in ``config/connection.js`` to your own. Once this is done run ``schema.sql`` in your SQL workbench to create the database and then run ``node seeds/index.js`` to seed the database. Finally to use the app you will need to run ``node server.js`` or ``npm start``.
